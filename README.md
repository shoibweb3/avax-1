# Overview
This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for an ERC20 token (ERC20.sol) and a simple vault (Vault.sol). The ERC20 contract implements the standard ERC20 interface with basic functionalities like transferring tokens, approving spender, and burning tokens. The vault contract allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens and receive shares in return, which can then be used to withdraw tokens proportionally.

# Contracts
ERC20.sol: This contract implements the ERC20 token standard with the following features:

. Minting and burning tokens.
. Transferring tokens between addresses.
. Approving spender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
. Checking balance and allowance of addresses.
. Vault.sol: This contract represents a vault where users can deposit ERC20 tokens and receive shares in return. It includes the following functionalities:

Depositing ERC20 tokens: Users can deposit tokens into the vault and receive shares proportional to their deposit.
Withdrawing ERC20 tokens: Users can withdraw tokens from the vault by providing the number of shares they want to redeem.

# Usage
. Deploy ERC20.sol contract to create your own ERC20 token.
. Deploy Vault.sol, passing the address of the ERC20 token contract as a constructor parameter.
. Users can deposit tokens into the vault using the deposit function, receiving shares in return.
. Users can withdraw tokens from the vault using the withdraw function, providing the number of shares they want to redeem.
# Security Considerations
. Ensure proper access control to the mint and burn functions in the ERC20 contract.
. Implement additional security measures such as withdrawal limits, access controls, and thorough testing to ensure the safety of user funds.
. Consider auditing the contracts by security experts before deploying them in a production environment.
